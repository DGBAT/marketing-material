# marketing-material

The resources available here are intended to help DigiByte reach more people through quality promo materials. Everything is free to use.

The material is organised into four categories:

  Promotional Images - Spark interest, prove a point or poke at the competition.
  Spec & tech sheets - Show these off to other projects interested in interacting with DGB.
  Printables - Print them out, spread them around, put them on your wall.
  Educational material - Share the knowledge. Use stylish resources while doing so.

This repository is a continuation of the work of Damir Cengic and Nigel Borreman who, in 2018, created PromoteDGB. whilst the PromoteDGB website is no longer active, Damir's work lives on here, aimed at empowering the DigiByte community with quality promotional materials.
